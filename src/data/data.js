export const story = "In a quiet village corner, long before the clink of cutlery and the bustle of waitstaff, there was a modest family kitchen where every meal was made with intention, every recipe held a memory, and every dish told a story. It was here, in the warmth of that home, where our journey began—not with a business plan, but with a grandmother’s laughter, the aroma of slow-cooked spices, and the joy of serving loved ones seated around a shared table. Our founders didn’t start with ambitions of opening a restaurant. They started with love—love for their heritage, love for authentic food, and love for the moments that happen over a great meal. Neighbors would stop by to taste the curry bubbling on the stove, to borrow an ingredient, or to learn the secret behind our now-signature dishes. Word spread faster than any marketing ever could. Over time, that small home kitchen became something more. Walls expanded, tables multiplied, and our family of customers grew—friends, travelers, food lovers, and families seeking comfort, nostalgia, and something real. What was once a handful of recipes passed down through generations evolved into a full menu that captures the soul of who we are. But our mission never changed. To this day, every meal we prepare holds the spirit of that very first kitchen: honest ingredients, traditional methods, and a deep respect for the culture that birthed it all. Whether it’s your first visit or your hundredth, when you dine with us, you’re not just eating—you’re being welcomed into our story, into our family, and into a tradition that continues to simmer with heart. This is more than just a restaurant. This is home. This is heritage. This is where flavors and family meet.";
